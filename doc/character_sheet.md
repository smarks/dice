# Characters
A character can be anything. There are no predefined character classes. There are only skills and attributes (characteristics)  which affect how good a character is at specific activities.
If you find this is too open, character templates are available.

## Attributes
Character generation starts out by defining the character’s attributes. Here's the list of attributes each character has and their definition.

**Strength** str
effects: carrying, hitting, damage, endurance, [action points](#action-points "Action Points")

**Dexterity** dex
effects: hitting, parrying, stealth, [action points](#action-points "Action Points")

**Intellect** int
effects: perception, arcane, learning skills

**Wisdom** wis
effects: how all your other attributes interact.

**Constitution** con
effects: health, endurance, resistances, [action points](#action-points "Action Points")

**Personality** per
effect: influence, leadership, moral, believability, credibility, charisma

### Some Terminology

**Base / Natural**
Unmodified attributes are called _natural_ or _base_ attributes or characteristics.

**Adjusted / Effective**
An _adjusted_ or _effective_ attribute refers to the attribute value after all modifiers have been applied. For example, wearing armor decreases your character’s dexterity attribute, the effective dexterity lower than the natural (rolled) value.

Typically adjusted values of attributes are used for determining outcomes but aren't called out explicitly as such. When documentation says "str" it almost always means _adjusted_ or _effective_ str not the natural (rolled) value your character starts out with.

For example, when an attribute is references in a formula

   A roll of under  **dex** - footwork skill  = success

the attribute is considered to be the _adjusted_ attribute, not the natural or base attribute.  

### _quick understanding check_

Fred has footwork skill (you will learn more about skills in a moment) of 2 Fred has a base dex of 12 but has a -2 modifier because of armor. Making his adjusted dex 10, but he also has a fancy sword that gives a +1 dex so his adjusted dex is:

(Choose one)

11
12
3
17

11 is correct. (12 - 2 malus = 10 + 1 bonus for fancy sword)

So the formula for a successful use of footwork skill - called a  circle close would be:

A roll under 11 (which is adjusted dex) + 2 (skill with footwork) = success 

Which rolls would make Fred and his player happy?

- 20
- 13 or lower
- 1, 2 
- 3
- 15 or higher
- 12 or lower

### Attribute Modifiers 
#### Pluses | Minuses / Bonuses | Malus

The following bonus(+) or malus(-) are applied to any activity that relies on a specific attribute.

| Attribute | =/-       |
| --------- | --------- |
| 0-2       | Paralyzed |
| 3         | -4        |
| 4         | -3        |
| 5         | -2        |
| 6         | -1        |
| 7 - 14    | 0         |
| 15-16     | +1        |
| 17        | +2        |
| 18        | +3        |
[Modifiers for Attribute Values]

### Attributes and Skills
As is standard across the genre, mental base attributes are helpful for activities that require more brain power and physical activities revolve around strength and dexterity. While a good constitution and a winning personality are more generally useful. However, unlike many systems, there is not a tight coupling between a successful fighter and high physical characters, or a successful mage with high mental attributes. The correlation is common, but  it is not unheard of a character’s skills and abilities be out of alignment with one or more attributes considered typically high for that “type of” character. In Pillars, a character is a gestalt not just attributes.

Bonuses / Malus from attributes and skills stack. That is you if have Str of 18 and therefore a +3 to hit, and skill 3 with sword, your total is +6 to hit.

All attributes and the best skill stack. e.g. a character with Dex 18 and Str 18 and 3 with parry and skill 6 with striking would what?
- 8
- 9
- 4
- 3

8 --\> dex + 3 / Str + 3 max skill is staking (6) which 1/3 so plus 2

### Physical and a mental base
All characters begin by determining their physical and mental base.

These attributes serve as the foundation for related characteristics giving them a sense of consistency,  The physical and mental base of a character is determined by character race. 

Here's how to determine physical base for common races. If you want to run a character of some other race discuss with the GM. 

- [Humans](#character-races "Character Races") roll 4 d8 pick two
- [Elves](#character-races "Character Races") roll 6 d6 pick two
- [Dwarves](#character-races "Character Races") roll 6 d6 pick two and add +3 for physical and -2 for mental
- [Gnomes](#character-races "Character Races") 4 d6  and pick two

Draft —
- Small Folk roll 4 d4 pick two add +1 to each base 
- Hillmen roll 4 d6 pick highest and add +3 for physical base then  roll 2 d4 and pick one for mental base.
-  Fae roll 4 d6  pick two  and +3 for mental and -2 for physical

## Skill Points
Skill points are used to learn just about anything. The more skill points you have in a specific skill, the better you are at it. Typically skills cost 1 skill point for level one skills, 2 skill points for level 2 and so on. You need skills be more effective with just about anything you want to do. If you don't have a skill and try an activity, you do so with skill 0 which is entirely possible (you aren't prevent from trying) but you won't be very good at it.

### Starting action points 
6 + str bonus + dex bonus + con bonus + highest bonus from a skill - armor and shield encumbrance
For most "actiony" skills, the bonus is skill / 3. Action point bonuses occur at skills 2, 5, and 8


Skills can anything you'd like your character to be better at. Here are some common examples:

- Bastard Sword Attack skill 1

In this example, the character would be +1 to hit with Bastard Sword and weapon skill/ 1/3 of weapons  round up for the class of weapons Bastard Sword falls under. (E.g. medium weight weapons would be 1/2 = 1)

- tracking

Make it easier to track.

- forest lore

Would make it easier to track, but not as good just having the tracker skill but make it easier to find good places to camp, and identify fauna etc. It is a more general skill that is less effective (but better than no skill) in a variety of related areas.

Skills can anything. If it is not obvious, e.g. Bastard Sword Parry +1, discuss with the GM for refinement.  Be as creative as you'd like. Have fun.

If more than skill gives the same bonus, only the skill with the highest bonus is applied.

A list of common skills can be found here

## Hit Points and Fatigue Points
Fatigue is your endurance. Your energy level. The harder or longer an activity is, the more endurance is required.  The sum of your attributes are your starting fatigue points . Each level add the results of a d6 + the sum of attribute malus or bonus from race (see below) and attributes as you apply your characters constitution malus or bonus to this roll.

Hit Points indicate how much physical or mental damage a character can sustain. Cuts, bruises, etc. Hit points are determined by the sum of Str, Con, and Dex. plus your physical base.  Each level a d6 + the sum of attribute malus or bonus from race (see below) and attributes as you apply your characters constitution malus or bonus to this roll.

Neither Hit Points and Fatigue points can be directly affected by skills. Instead use skill points to affect associated attributes.

### Starting Hit Points
Starting hit points = Str + Con 

#### Hit Point progression.
Characters get a D6 + Con per level. 

### Starting Fatigue Points
Starting fatigue points = con + dex + wis

#### Fatigue point progression:
At each level add the results of a d6 + constitution modifier at  added to your character’s fatigue points.
 
### Fatigue
Negative fatigue unconscious
0 fatigue - semi conscious state
1/2 fatigue -1
Full fatigue +1

### Hit Points
Negative hp - the negative value 
0 hp -3
1/2 hp -1
Full hp +1

### Death
When a character’s hit points is equal or below their constitution they are near death. A constitution check is required each turn the character hit points are equal or below their constitution. For each turn in this state, apply a -1 penalty to constitution. (Adjusted constitution drops by 1 each turn) and d20 must be lower than the adjusted constitution.

In addition, if a character’s hit points are below their constitution, adjust their constitution by that value. .

For example, Jake has a con 12 and 20 hit points. He loses 32 hit points over the course of a melee. When he reaches -12 hit points his player rolls a d20. If they roll a 12 or lower, Jake lives another turn. On the next turn, they need to roll a 11 or lower as a -1 is applied. The turn after add another -1, now a 10 is required. This progression continues until Jake is healed (his hit points are greater than his con) or dies.

Another example,
Jake has a con 12 and 20 hit points. He loses 35 hit points over the course of a melee. He is now at -15 and with a constitution he has -3 penalty so his player must now roll a 9 (12 - 3)  to live another turn. On the next turn and subsequent turns, a -1 is applied until Jake either expires or is wounds are staunched (which requires the medic skill) or otherwise healed (which requires one or more other specific skills).  So on the second turn his player which of the following to live yet another turn:

- 20
- 13
- 9 or less
- 8 or less
- 5

## Character Races
Currently races include

- **Humans** (wide ranging in all manner of characteristics) Come in a variety of flavors depending on region. No malus or bonuses except by region - see GM for details.
		examples:
		- descendant from old empire
		        - cty dweller
		                - mountains, Woods
		                - highlands

- **Elves** 
		- **Wood** smaller and more slender than typical humans, live in the woods as one member of the forest ecosystem. Isolationists. Ill tempered towards any that share their values. constitution +1, wood lore skill +2
		
		- **High** Typically taller, more slender than typical humans who don't seem to age. Considered wise and intelligent but often also skilled in various martial arts (in the most general sense of the term). Aloof isolationists. Not often encountered. Sometimes a lone high elf will seek the company of other races.  constitution +2

- **Dwarves** The best artisans.  Doughty warriors when roused. Always bearded and often cranky. Intolerant isolationists. Female Dwarves are a mystery. constitution +1, strength +1, -1 dex, -1 personality +1 craftsmanship

- **Gnomes** Similar to dwarves but lesser in all respects including their dislike for other races and direct opposite in disposition to their cousins the dwarves. Note: dwarves typically  look down about Gnomes while Gnomes typically roll their eyes at their less gregarious cousins. Beards are typical for males, but not always worn. Female Gnomes are obvious. constitution +1, strength +1,  intelligence or wisdom +1

Draft —
- **Fae**  A magical folk who typically keep to themselves but sometimes venture into human society either out of curiosity or perhaps a Geas. Malus and bonuses vary - see games master.

- **Small Folk** Not Hobbits, Not halflings, humanoids of dominative statue, not as stout as Dwarves but more nimble and clever. Not worldly. Isolationist. Rarely encountered. Sometimes mixed up with gnomes to neither their or the Gnomes amusement. str -2, dex +1, per +1

- \*\*Hill People \*\*  rough, doughty, ill tempered, focus on the physical and the mental less so. Typical do not mix well with other races living in wild and untamed places. Str +2, con +2, dex + 1, personality -3, intelligence or wisdom -1

- \*\*Snake People \*\* Clearly a race of being far different than other humanoids. Also called Lizard Men and Dragon Spawn. Some say they are result of a fae and dragon coupling although there is only vague speculation on that would really work. Given the different natures of each. Snake people are generally taller, and heavier than other races including all but the most robust Hill people, but there are also variations. In one extreme, a snake person can appear extremely lizard like in skin texture and pattern and claw like hands and feet to the other extreme where they present as shallow skinned humans.  Some say these physical manifestations are phases in their growth while others speculate that there are different classes of Snake People.

		Often viewed by other races as haughty bullies and sometimes thuggish.  They do possess superior mental and physical attributes.  Amongst themselves they subscribe to a strong well formulated cultural and political hierarchy which is largely opaque to outsiders.  Snake people rarely go mingle with other races, when they do, it is typically because an individual has either been ostracized from their community or completing an initiation rite that entails learning about as much as they can from outside of their community. There communities themselves are typically secreted away and not accessible to outsiders. The old empire was said to be organized and run by a  Cabal of Snake people  but that was in the distant past, and certainly the old empire's population and those that are considered descendants of the old empire are humans. 
		
		Attribute modifiers are not public

### Starting skill points
Add physical and mental base to get your starting skill points.
You can use these points for skills but one type of skill is increasing your character attributes. The skill point cost for increasing character attributes works a bit different than most other skills. Here's how it differs.

- Attributes that are less than 11 cost 1 skill point to increase by 1  and then doubled for each additional increase.  2 for level 2, 3 for level 3 etc.
- Attributes that are between 12-15 cost 2 skill point to increase by 1 for the first level and then doubled for each additional level increase. 4 for level 2, 8 for level 3 etc.
- Attributes that  are 16 cost 3 skill point to increase by 1 for the first level and then doubled for each additional increase. 6 for level 2, 12 for level 3 etc.
- Attributes that are 17 cost 4 skill point to increase by 1 for the first level and then doubled for each additional increase.  8 for level 2, 16 for level 3 etc.
- Attributes that 18 or greater  cost 5 skill point to increase by 1 for the first level and then doubled for each additional increase.  5, 10, 15

|               |       |       |       |       |       |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|               |       |       |       |       |       |
|               | **Skill Level**                   |||||
| **Attribute** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
| **\> 11**     | 1     | 2     | 4     | 8     | 16    |
| **12-15**     | 2     | 4     | 8     | 16    | 32    |
| **16**        | 3     | 6     | 12    | 24    | 48    |
| **17**        | 4     | 8     | 16    | 32    | 64    |
| **18 \<**     | 5     | 10    | 20    | 40    | 80    |
|               | **Required Skill Points**         |||||


Here's an example.  Consider this character:

Str 16
Dex 12
Con 12
Int  10
Wis 12
Pers 10

To increases strength by 1 would cost 3 points
To increases strength by 2 would cost 3 points for the first increase, and then 6 for the additional point for a total of 9 points.

To increases intelligence by 1 would cost 1 points  intelligence is now 11
To increases intelligence by 2 would cost 1 point to get to 11 and then 2 points + the level increase (in this case 2) for a total of 4 to go from 11 to 12.

Keep track of:
- original value of an attribute
- each modification (skill point addition) to an attribute

E.g
Str starts 11 (natural)
You spend 1 skill points  to get Str 12
You spend 4 skill points to get to Str 13
You spend 8 skill points  to get to Str 14

# Action Points
Every character has action points. Action points allow a character to do something when the game is a turned based mode.

(The game becomes turned based when individual actions matter).

\*\* Characters start with 6 AP, add attribute and skill bonuses/malus, and subtract armor and shield encumbrance.

When the game becomes turns based, each player rolls a d6/2 round down and adds that value to their total number of action points.
That number is their initiative roll.
The turn proceed with the character who has the highest initiative roll.
Action with characters with tied initiative roll happen simultaneously.

The character with the highest AP goes first. They can use as many Action Points as they wish until their number of action points is lower than the next highest character.
e.g.
Fred has 8 points and rolls a d6 gets 1  / 2 round down for a 0 modifier for initiative roll and end up with an 8 for initiative
Joe has 6 and rolls a d6 gets 6 /2 for 3 additional initiative points for a total of nine 9 for initiative
Fran as 4 and rolls a d6 gets 5 /2 round down 2  for a total of  6 initiative points.

Joe goes first. He spends 2 for a light weapon attack. He is at 4 points now. ( 2 - total action points of 6 = 4)
Fred is at 8 so he can parry and he does for -1. Now he's at 7 and has the most points. He can swing for 2 at Joe. Now he is at 5 and Joe is at 4. Joe can't do anything yet.
Fran has the most points so she can spend 2 and swing at Joe. Now she's at 4 and Joe is at 4. He can parry Fran. He does. Now he's at 3.
Fran is at 4
Joe is at 4 3
Fred is at 5
Fred goes. He swings at Fran. He's at 3 now. Fran is at 4 - she spends 1 to parry She's at 3 now.
Joe is at 3
Fran is at 3
Fred is at 3
Everyone goes at the same time.

### 0  (Free Actions)

**Defensive**

standard weapon parry
reduce chance to be struck by 2 + parry skill
### 3
standard weapon attack 3

### 4
great weapon parry 4
full movement 4

### 5
great weapon attack 5

## Movement
Sum adjusted dex, str, con = number of feet per turn movement.

## Combat

Characters roll for initiative a d6 + AP
Order is determined from high to low.

highest roll goes first.
after the initial turn, the person with the highest AP goes first.
if more than one character has the ap combat is simulations.

Here's an example of three people fighting each other:

For simplicity no one is wearing any armor.

Jake has an AP of 10 and rolled 6 on d6 for an initiative of 16
he fights with great sword which is a two handed striking weapon.
a great sword has a reach of 3 to 6

Asaper has an AP of 8 and rolled4 on d6 for an initiative of 12
she fights with a short word and round shield.
a short sword as a reach of 2-4

Mateo has an AP of 10 and rolled 1 on d6 for an initiative of 11
he fights with a long sword sometimes two handed sometimes one handed. He has no shield
a long sword has a reach of 3-5

# Experience 
As characters do things, they are awarded experience points. As these points accumulate the character “goes up in level” and when that happens, the character gets additional fatigue points, hit points, and skill points. You get 1 skill point per sub-level. You roll your fatigue and hit points die when a new level is reached. That number is divided by the number of sub-levels rounded down, and that value is awarded at each sub-level
